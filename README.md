# drillhole

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Start server
```
npm run start
```
This project operates with SQLite that has been set up to build a database on memory, so no separate database set up is required. The above command also initiates seeding, so you'll start off with 3 drill holes and 100 depth readings per drill hole.

The server will be hosted on http://localhost:8081.

### Compiles and serves website
```
npm run serve
```

This is where you'll be accessing the site from. On successful compile, go to http://localhost:8080 to access the site. Make sure the server is running before you open the site, otherwise it won't completely load.

If you Found some error with "faker"

please install the dependencies with

```
npm install faker
```

and then start with project setup and start server again!

thankyou
